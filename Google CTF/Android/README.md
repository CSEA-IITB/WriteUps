# Android

We're given a [reverse.apk](./reverse.apk) file, which when installed opens up a screen where we can enter a key and it would show whether the key is correct or not.

The first thing one would do with any apk is JADX, and, it gives 3 errors!!
And yet, the apk runs nicely! What's going on? Must be some issue with JADX since it is not maintained right :P

```java

        final EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText);
        final TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView);
        ((Button) findViewById(R.id.button)).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            /*  JADX ERROR: Method load error
                jadx.core.utils.exceptions.DecodeException: Load method exception: Not class type: long in method: com.google.ctf.sandbox.ￅﾑ.1.onClick(android.view.View):void, dex: classes.dex
```

This didn't make any sense to me, so I resorted to reading the [smali](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali) next! (Smali can be obtained by using [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/))

First of all, we note from the AndroidManifest that the app loads in the activity named `com.google.ctf.sandbox.ő`. It so appears that apktool can't work very nicely with non-ASCII characters, so first of all let's rename the `ő` everywhere to `o`, and now atleast apktool can happily build the apk.

Yeah, we all know smali is kind-of assembly for Dalvik VMs, however, note that it has lot of instructions compared to x86, I referred to [opcodes](http://pallergabor.uw.hu/androidblog/dalvik_opcodes.html) to understand what each instruction did.

[Registers](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/wiki/Registers) & [Types,Methods,Fields](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/wiki/TypesMethodsAndFields) proved to be very useful in the understanding of the smali too!!

## Step 1 :
What next? Let's head on to the renamed main activity(`com.google.ctf.sandbox.o`) :

```
# instance fields
.field class:[J

.field o:I

.field o:[J
```

The references tell us that the types are as follows -
![](types.png)

So the thing here is that `class` is a field of the Java class `o`, and is an array of long integers, the first `o` is an integer, and the second `o` is again an array of long integers.

Heading on to the constructor now -

```
# direct methods
.method public constructor <init>()V
    .locals 14

    .line 11
    invoke-direct {p0}, Landroid/app/Activity;-><init>()V

    :catch_0
    :try_start_0
    const/16 v0, 0xc

    new-array v1, v0, [J

    fill-array-data v1, :array_0

    iput-object v1, p0, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o;->class:[J

    .line 16
    new-array v0, v0, [J

    iput-object v0, p0, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o;->o:[J

    .line 17
    const/4 v0, 0x0

    iput v0, p0, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o;->o:I
    :try_end_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Exception; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Error; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
    .catch I {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_1

    goto/16 :goto_0

    :try_start_1
    const/16 v0, 0xc

    :catch_1
    :goto_0
    return-void

    :array_0
    .array-data 8
        0x271986b
        0xa64239c9L
        0x271ded4b
        0x1186143
        0xc0fa229fL
        0x690e10bf
        0x28dca257
        0x16c699d1
        0x55a56ffd
        0x7eb870a1
        0xc5c9799fL
        0x2f838e65
    .end array-data
    :try_end_1
    .catch Ljava/lang/Exception; {:try_start_1 .. :try_end_1} :catch_0
.end method
```

We'd also need to check a bit about passing arguments, again the smali-wiki is quite helpful
![](args.png)

To this constructor, the first argument which is an implicit `this` argument, is passed and hence, is stored in the first parameter register - the parameter registers are numbered as `p0, p1 ...` - here `p0` contains this, and then we invoke the constructor of its `super`-class, and so on!

However, what really caught my eye is the try-catch block! Does it even make sense - You try to catch an exception between `try_start_0` to `try_end_0` - and if you do catch an exception, you goto `catch_0` which again leads to `try_start_0` - what the heck!

```
    :catch_0
    :try_start_0

    ... //lots of code

    :try_end_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Exception; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Error; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
    .catch I {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
```

Probably, no exception was generated here - which would mean no such infinite loop thing - so let's try removing this try-catch thing altogether, and see if the app runs properly now?

We also note that there could be no exception between `try_start_1` & `try_end_1` either - hence remove that as well!

Build it using apktool, jadx it(reverse_1.apk), and we obtain only 1 error now, compared to earlier 3 - Progress!!!

```java
public class o extends Activity {

    /* renamed from: class  reason: not valid java name */
    long[] f0class = {40999019, 2789358025L, 656272715, 18374979, 3237618335L, 1762529471, 685548119, 382114257, 1436905469, 2126016673, 3318315423L, 797150821};
    int o = 0;

    /* renamed from: o  reason: collision with other field name */
    long[] f1o = new long[12];

    /* access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        final EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText);
        final TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView);
        ((Button) findViewById(R.id.button)).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            /*  JADX ERROR: Method load error
                jadx.core.utils.exceptions.DecodeException: Load method exception: Not class type: long in method: com.google.ctf.sandbox.o.1.onClick(android.view.View):void, dex: classes.dex
```

Though one of the errors didn't go away, the others sure did, and we got the initializing data for the `class(or f0class)` field as well! But does the app run?

`Note - Only signed APKs would run on phone, so sign the apk with something like jarsigner etc`

It sure does, and with no difference what-so-ever!!!! Note that this apk is [reverse_1](reverse_1.apk)

<p align="center">
<img src="step_1.jpg" width="200" height="300" />
</p>

## Step 2
Cool, but now what? Notice that the error pops up in `setOnClickListener` of button in `onCreate` method of `o` - and also note that the error is in `com.google.ctf.sandbox.o.1.onClick` - the closest meaning I can take is `o$1.smali`, it probably calls in code from there?

Heading there now!

```
# instance fields
.field final synthetic this$0:Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o;

.field final synthetic val$editText:Landroid/widget/EditText;

.field final synthetic val$textView:Landroid/widget/TextView;
```

Three fields - first is a reference to the `this` object of `o` class, the next is an `EditText`(where our input goes) and the third is a `TextView`(where the output comes back)!

Again, the `init`(constructor) & the `onClick` - this is where the main execution must happen right? We press `Check` and this tells what to do. Glancing through the code - it's toooo big - 800+ lines - but some of it seems to be repititive and redundant at the same time, we see a "key", a "keyString", a "flagString" etc.

I tried to follow the path of execution - we encounter a "goto_0" which takes us to an initialization thing and then to "goto_1" which looks like a loop, then there is a "cond_0" and then at that point it takes the textview and sets its text to something in unicode, which actually are emojis - one is flag, and another is cross(wrong).

And then, a try-catch again! Why don't I just go ahead and remove it? Let's do that!

```
    if-eqz v5, :cond_1

    .line 54
    iget-object v5, v1, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o$1;->val$textView:Landroid/widget/TextView;

    const-string v6, "\ud83d\udea9"

    invoke-virtual {v5, v6}, Landroid/widget/TextView;->setText(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)V

    goto :goto_2

    .line 56
    :cond_1
    iget-object v5, v1, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o$1;->val$textView:Landroid/widget/TextView;

    const-string v6, "\u274c"

    invoke-virtual {v5, v6}, Landroid/widget/TextView;->setText(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)V
    :try_end_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Exception; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Error; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
    .catch J {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
```

Let's check again then! JADX still reports an error! Some different error this time, and the method `onClick` has a lot of register shit as well.

```java
        final TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView);
        ((Button) findViewById(R.id.button)).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            /*  JADX ERROR: JadxRuntimeException in pass: BlockFinish
                jadx.core.utils.exceptions.JadxRuntimeException: Dominance frontier not set for block: B:1:0x0011
                ... */
        public void onClick(android.view.View r19) {
                /*
                    r18 = this;
                    r1 = r18
                    com.google.ctf.sandbox.o r2 = com.google.ctf.sandbox.o.this
                    ... */

```

And again, does the [reverse_2](reverse_2.apk) run? It doesn't!

<p align="center">
<img src="step_2.jpg" width="300" height="300" />
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/2hwufo.jpg" width="400"/>
</p>

## Step 3

A `ClassCastException`, from the same `onClick`, and that too from line 51? But what would cause this? What is at line 51?

```
    .line 51
    .local v8, "chr":Ljava/lang/Object;
    move-object v9, v8

    check-cast v9, Ljava/lang/Character;

    invoke-virtual {v9}, Ljava/lang/Character;->charValue()C

    move-result v9
```

And then I realized after reading some opcodes - `check-cast` raises a `ClassCastException` if the cast is not possible.

![](cast.png)

Ohhh boy! Ahh, this was inside the try-catch! But can I rectify this now? Note that as observable from the error itself, `v9` must be of `java.lang.Integer` type, and a few lines down, I am trying to obtain its corresponding ASCII character probably. Searching for integer to character conversion, in 'smali', we come across the right opcode -

```
int-to-char vx, vy ->
Converts the int value in vy to a char value and stores it in vx.
```

But note, `v9` is not an int, it is an object of `Object` class, but probably can be cast to `Integer` class - googling up, we come across a method called `intValue()` of `Integer` class - seems to be an apt one!

Using the above methods, the smali can now be edited to avoid the error -

```
    .line 51
    .local v8, "chr":Ljava/lang/Object;
    move-object v9, v8

    check-cast v9, Ljava/lang/Integer;

    invoke-virtual {v9}, Ljava/lang/Integer;->intValue()I

    move-result v9

    int-to-char v9, v9
```

Again, the usual thing - apktool, JADX, and finally sign and run. (reverse_3)(reverse_3.apk)

JADX gives the same error again! However, this time the app runs nicely, same as before!

## Step 4

Maybe I can print the key-string this time? It could lead to something?

```
    .line 50
    .local v3, "keyString":Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
```

`v3` contains the keyString.

```
    invoke-virtual {v3}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->toString()Ljava/lang/String;

    move-result-object v6

    invoke-virtual {v5, v6}, Ljava/lang/String;->equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z

    move-result v5

    if-eqz v5, :cond_1

    .line 54
    iget-object v5, v1, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o$1;->val$textView:Landroid/widget/TextView;

    const-string v6, "\ud83d\udea9"

    invoke-virtual {v5, v6}, Landroid/widget/TextView;->setText(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)V

    goto :goto_2

    .line 56
    :cond_1
    iget-object v5, v1, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o$1;->val$textView:Landroid/widget/TextView;

    const-string v6, "\u274c"

    invoke-virtual {v5, v6}, Landroid/widget/TextView;->setText(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)V
    :try_end_0
```

Okay, so `v3` is converted to a String from a StringBuilder, and then tested with the input probably, which is in `v5`; and accordingly the text in the textview is set. I'll rather ask it to print the keyString itself :)

So we remove the condition line - `if-eqz v5, :cond_1` as well as the line which sets the thing - `const-string v6, "\ud83d\udea9"`, this character is actually the flag character; while the other one in - `const-string v6, "\u274c"` is the cross character, as can be seen in the following images obtained from [Unicode-converter](https://www.online-toolz.com/tools/text-unicode-entities-convertor.php) -

<p align="center">
<img src="flag.png" width="300" height="300" />
<img src="cross.png" width="300" height="300" />
</p>

Apktool, JADX & run again!
Nah, JADX still does the same. But when we click Check, we should get something right?

<p align="center">
<img src="step_4.jpg" width="200" height="300" />
</p>

Ohhhh boi!! 
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/030/043/cover2.jpg" width="400"/>
</p>

So that wasn't the flag? All my life has been a lie!

Maybe, the try-catch was catching the exception and relaying it somewhere else? However, we now know that a lot of code was doing nothing at all, it was just a waste to let us on the wrong way!

## Step 5

```
    :try_end_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Exception; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
    .catch Ljava/lang/Error; {:try_start_0 .. :try_end_0} :catch_0
```

The execution begins from `catch_0` right? 

```
    :catch_0
    const/16 v2, 0x31

    const/4 v3, 0x0

    const/4 v4, 0x3

    const/4 v5, 0x2

    const/4 v6, 0x1

    const/4 v7, 0x4

    goto/16 :goto_3
```

```
    .line 85
    .end local v2    # "key":[Ljava/lang/Object;
    .end local v3    # "keyString":Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
    :goto_2
    goto/16 :goto_5

    .line 58
    .line 60
    .local v2, "e":Ljava/lang/Exception;
    :goto_3
    :try_start_1
    iget-object v3, v1, Lcom/google/ctf/sandbox/o$1;->val$editText:Landroid/widget/EditText;
```

The data is re-initialized, the execution begins from `goto_3` - which is after this whole `keyString` code, and hoping that no previous data would be used, I removed all the code which was checking the `keyString` and all, right from `try_start_0`, up till `goto_2`; as well as the instruction which told to `goto_0`, and all the initializations before `catch_0` as well(those are actually the same as the ones in `catch_0` :)!

```
    const/16 v2, 0x31

    const/4 v3, 0x0

    const/4 v4, 0x3

    const/4 v5, 0x2

    const/4 v6, 0x1

    const/4 v7, 0x4

    goto :goto_0

    const/16 v2, 0x31

    :catch_0
```

Oh there's another try-catch at the bottom, might as well remove that?

```
    .catch Ljava/lang/Exception; {:try_start_1 .. :try_end_1} :catch_0
```

Let's see what happens now?

```
INFO  - loading ...
INFO  - processing ...
INFO  - done
```

JADX gave no errors!!!! Let's just read the Java code then :)

```java
        long[] f1o = new long[12];

            public void onClick(View v) {
                o.this.o = 0;
                String flagString = editText.getText().toString();
                if (flagString.length() != 48) {
                    textView.setText("❌");
                    return;
                }
                for (int i = 0; i < flagString.length() / 4; i++) {
                    o.this.f1o[i] = (long) (flagString.charAt((i * 4) + 3) << 24);
                    long[] jArr = o.this.f1o;
                    jArr[i] = jArr[i] | ((long) (flagString.charAt((i * 4) + 2) << 16));
                    long[] jArr2 = o.this.f1o;
                    jArr2[i] = jArr2[i] | ((long) (flagString.charAt((i * 4) + 1) << 8));
                    long[] jArr3 = o.this.f1o;
                    jArr3[i] = jArr3[i] | ((long) flagString.charAt(i * 4));
                }
                o oVar = o.this;
                if (((R.o(o.this.f1o[o.this.o], 4294967296L)[0] % 4294967296L) + 4294967296L) % 4294967296L != o.this.f0class[o.this.o]) {
                    textView.setText("❌");
                    return;
                }
                o.this.o++;
                if (o.this.o >= o.this.f1o.length) {
                    textView.setText("🚩");
                    return;
                }
                throw new RuntimeException();
```

First check is whether the `flagString` is 48 characters long. Then, there is some computation up next, and there is a check after that, and then there is an exception thrown, in case the first check succeeds, until the value of `o.this.o` becomes atleast `o.this.f1o.length`.

```
    :cond_5
    new-instance v8, Ljava/lang/RuntimeException;

    invoke-direct {v8}, Ljava/lang/RuntimeException;-><init>()V

    throw v8

    :goto_5
    return-void

    nop

    .array-data 8
        0x1
    .end array-data
    :try_end_1
    // removed line .catch Ljava/lang/Exception; {:try_start_1 .. :try_end_1} :catch_0
```

This thrown exception, as we can see above, was catched by `catch_0`, and since `o.this.o` has been incremented, it would probably go back up again, and so the same check would be done for other input values as well, thus, this try-catch, which we just removed, was a loop!

But how is this check happening, we see a call to an `R.o` function! Let's read that up?

```java
    // in R.java
    public static long[] o(long a, long b) {
        if (a == 0) {
            return new long[]{0, 1};
        }
        long[] r = o(b % a, a);
        return new long[]{r[1] - ((b / a) * r[0]), r[0]};
    }
```

This looks like a function which solves `a*x + b*y = gcd(a,b)` for `x` & `y`, given `a` & `b`, where `b` has been fixed to be `4294967296L`, and `x` is computed, based on given `a`, and is tested whether it's equal to the data in the array `f0class` at the proper position. If this check succeeds for the whole array, a flag is shown, else a cross is shown in the TextView.

```java
    long[] f0class = {40999019, 2789358025L, 656272715, 18374979, 3237618335L, 1762529471, 685548119, 382114257, 1436905469, 2126016673, 3318315423L, 797150821};
    int o = 0;

    /* renamed from: o  reason: collision with other field name */
    long[] f1o = new long[12];
```

It so looks like the string, being 48 characters long(to satisfy the first check), has been divided into 12 4-characters, each 4-character is read as a 4-byte integer in the least-endian order, and then considering that as `a`, `x` is computed modulo the given `b` and is then checked to the corresponding value in the array `f0class`.

We are given `x`s, in the form of data from `f0class` array, & `b`, and we want to obtain the `a`s, which satisfy `a*x + b*y = gcd(a,b)` for their corresponding `x`s; and the `a`s should give then us the flag!

But again, there could be many `a`s for a particular `x`? I just assumed that `gcd(a,b)` was `1`, and hence, that `a` was actually `x^(-1) % b`, a unique value - and as it turns out, this gave us the right answer!

```python

import gmpy2

m = 4294967296
l = [40999019, 2789358025, 656272715, 18374979, 3237618335, 1762529471,
     685548119, 382114257, 1436905469, 2126016673, 3318315423, 797150821]

o = [gmpy2.invert(i, m) for i in l]

s = ''
for i in o:
    t = ''
    for j in range(4):
        t += chr(i % 256)
        i //= 256
    s += t

print(s)
```

And we obtain `s`, our flag, as - `CTF{y0u_c4n_k3ep_y0u?_m4gic_1_h4Ue_laser_b3ams!}`!

Putting this in the original [reverse.apk](reverse.apk), we obtain the flag -

</p>

This was a really good reversing challenge - the apk was surely custom made to not allow straight away decompilation, and then so many try-catches causing issues and a wrong track on the way tooo!! Overall, an awesome challenge in my opinion.
